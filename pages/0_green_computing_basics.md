# Key variables
The key variables in green computing are:
* Electricity Usage (kWh)
* Carbon Intensity (gCO2eq/kWh)
* Carbon Footprint (gCO2eq)
## Electricity Usage
Electricity usage is the amount of electricity consumed by a computing system. It is typically measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Reducing electricity usage can help to lower the carbon footprint of a computing system.
## Carbon Intensity
Carbon intensity is the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2eq) emitted per unit of
electricity consumed. It is typically measured in grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour (gCO2eq/kWh). Carbon intensity can vary depending on the source of electricity generation. For example, electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind or solar has a lower carbon intensity than electricity generated from fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas.
## Carbon Footprint
Carbon footprint is the total amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2eq) emitted by a
computing system. It is typically calculated by multiplying the electricity usage (kWh) by the carbon intensity (gCO2eq/kWh). Reducing the carbon footprint of a computing system can help to mitigate climate change.
